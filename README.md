    that it returns fizz.

Question 7.
    ANSWER

    .<script src="src/js/fizz-buzz.js"></script>

    So this would be linking the html script to the fizz-buzz.js file in the js folder in the src folder.

    .document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {

     This would be adding an event listener to the web app.

    .let button = document.getElementById('button')  

    Putting a button on the web app.

    .let displayDiv = document.getElementById('display_answer') 
    button.addEventListener('click', () =>{


    This is saying that the answer should be displayed when the button is pushed and an event listener waiting for the button to be pushed.

    .let value = document.getElementById('value').value

    I think this is inputting the number to play the game.

    .let fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz

    Afterwards start a new fizz buzz

    .let result = fizzBuzz.check(value)
        displayDiv.innerHTML = result;

    It will equals to Fizzbuzz depending on the number.
