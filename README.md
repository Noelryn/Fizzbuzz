### Fizzbuzz Weekend Challenge
- written in JavaScript 
- Feature test done using e2e training wheels



Question 1. 

let  fizzBuzz = fs.readFileSync('./src/js/fizz-buzz.js');
 eval( fizzBuzz + `\nexports.FizzBuzz = FizzBuzz;`)

 I think it is saying to let fizzbuzz file sync with the fizzbuzz Javascript file in the source folder.

 Question 2.

The reason "let fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz

Question 3.

"==": checks to see if objects are equal and returns true if so.

"===": checks to see of two objects are identical.
